# DarkCometTracker

## Abstract
In year 2017, the paper “To Catch a Ratter: Monitoring the Behavior of Amateur Dark Comet RAT Operators in the Wild”, has been published and provides the first reference for the work we are doing today as our Bachelor Thesis.
RATs are the so called Remote Access Trojans. They allow the people behind them, also called Operators, to remotely access to a victims computer, that has previously been infected. This can then be spied on, manipulated or totally taken over. Several RATs are available for free or at low prices on the Internet. The main topic of our work is the RAT DarkComet.
RATs like DarkComet are mostly used because of their usability and diversity.%simplicity on doing very bad things. 
The user interface is developed in a way that allows people without further knowledge on technology to use them.
On the one hand, it has been used by teenagers, "just for fun". On the other hand, it has been used by by intelligences, in a context like the war in Syria. Over all, there is relatively little detailed and systematic knowledge about the use of RATs or the behavior of their Operators. 
Remote Access Trojans should not be confused with the Remote Administration Tools, like TeamViewer, which represent the legal side of the application possibilities and will not be part of this work.

## Contents
* DarkComet_Tracker.pdf is the final report of the Bachelor Thesis.
* ProjectManagement.pdf defines how we planned and split up the work, between three people, during 16 weeks of work.
* Appendix A and B are additional documents required by our supervisors
* The Folder Structure/automatic contains the whole automation structure of the project. Of course, the sensitive data has not been published. Because of that some files are empty.
* The Scripts folder contains the scripts used during this work. They are divided by usage category.
